# Image Classification with CNNs

This project demonstrates image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Project Files
- `main.py`: The main script for loading data, building, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists required Python packages.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate results**:
   After training, the script will display the test accuracy and show a plot of the training history.

## CIFAR-10 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset, used in this project, contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
